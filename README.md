# CFS Bot

This bot is built with the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

The bot is designed to give Menu and Recipe information.  When you greet the bot ("Hello" for example), it will
present you with a [HeroCard](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/attachments.html) that
can guide the dialog through button prompts or you can ask the bot questions about menus or recipes.
